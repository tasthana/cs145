                Ixperience is a company based out of South Africa that hosts summer programs in Cape Town, SA and Lisbon, Portugal. I attended in the summer of '22.
                Selected as 1 of 10 in a group of 300+ students from the past summer program to represent IXperience's business development projects on the University of Vermont campus.
                Over 10 signups and 2000+ students reached for the ’23 summer utilizing Google Suite, posters, cards, and in-person presentations to spread the word for IXperience’s ’23 summer programs. 
                15+ clubs reached with the 3 pending partnerships with IX. Highlights my independent drive.
