                <h2>Magic Mirror Project</h2>
                <p>
                This project was a final in my CS 121 (Computer Organizing) class, which used Linux terminal and a Raspberry Pi to code. 
                Using base code from the Magic Mirror GitHub, my partner and I created 3 new modules customizable by the user.
                Working in Linux to allow seamless implementation through a Raspberry Pi 4 to project on screen, and designs to create a
                working mirror.

                <p>
                My travel website was the result of a final project assignment in my CS 008 class (Intro to Website Development). This site featured 
                three pages, an introduction page, and country's that I have visited page, and a form. I used HTML5 to create the structure of the page, 
                CSS to style it, and PHP to include some backend features of storage for my form page and tables that I had displayed. My form would also send 
                an email with a heartfelt response to whomever filled out the form!

                <h2>PyCharm Robot</h2>
                <p>
                My final project for CS 206 (Evolutionary Robotics) was a PyCharm Robot. Using PyCharm to simulate the effects of Earth's gravity, 
                I coded a robot using Python. Written in over a 1000 lines of code were the robots brain, body, and neurons and sensors that allowed 
                the user (me) to analyze the speed of the robot and the smoothness of its gait. The robot was evolved using a fitness function, to allow the best 
                combination of angles and brain activity to provide accurate data for the question behind my final project. Is more legs better for speed or not? 
                I modeled my robot after a spider, and created three variants, a 4 legged robot, a 6 legged one, and an 8 legged robot. The final presentation 
                included a paper with my full analysis and answer to my question, alongside a 2 minute presentation in class using graphs to prove my point.
